/**
 *  Write a Java program to model a college admission system using the concept of inner
 * classes. Create an outer class named College that stores the collegeName as a data member
 * and initializes it through a constructor. Within the College class, define a non-static inner
 * class named Admission that contains student-specific details such as the studentName and
 * the course they are enrolling in. The inner class should have methods to accept and display
 * student information, and it should also be able to access and display the collegeName stored
 * in the outer class. In the main method, create an object of the College class by passing the
 * collegeName, and then use this object to create an instance of the inner Admission class.
 * Invoke appropriate methods to input the student’s name and course, and then display the
 * complete admission details, including the college name
